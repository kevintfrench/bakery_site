	<h2>Description</h2>
	<p>
		Bethany received the recipe for this delicious apple pie from her grandmother. At the age of
		5,
		she
		was
		already baking this <em>all-American traditional apple</em> pie at her home.
		As the recipe goes a long way back, it contains the most typical ingredients used for so
		many
		years
		to
		make this classic even today one of our most popular pies.
	</p>
	<p>
		This pie is available <strong>every day</strong> and comes in 2 sizes. <span
			style="color:#c87d52; font-weight:bold ;">You can serve it cold or warm it for 4 minutes
			in
			the microwave to give it an extra touch. </span>Your house will smell just like
		Bethany's
		Shop!
	</p>
	<p>
	<blockquote>
		This recipe has been in our family for generations. We hope you enjoy this pie as we do -
		Bethany

<li>
	First, we combine sugar, flour and spices. We toss the apples with some lemon juice and
	add
	sugar.
</li>

<li>We then create the bottom crust and fill that with apple mixture. We put some butter on
	that. We
	then roll remaining crust to fit top of pie.
</li>
<li>Then we beat the eggs white until we have a foamy mix. That is then brushed over the
	crust.
	We
	sprinkle some extra sugar.
</li>
<li>Then the pie goes into the oven at 360Â° for 35 minutes. When ready, we let it cool on a
	wire
	rack.
</li>
